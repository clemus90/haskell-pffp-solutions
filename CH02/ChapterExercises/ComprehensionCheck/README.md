1. change the function for them to work in the REPL
    - half x = x / 2 → let half x = x / 2
    - square x = x * x → let square x = x * x

2. Write the function that receives a single parameter and works with the examples in the book
    - circleArea.hs

3. rewrite the previous function to use pi instead
    - circleAreaPi.hs
